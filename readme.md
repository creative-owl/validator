# Validator

The validator provides an easy to use uniform method of validating data types in JavaScript.

## Installing

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install @creativeowl/validator
```

## How to use

To use the module within your project you will need to have installed the package via NPM. Once included you may use the package anywhere as follows:

```js
const validate = require('@creativeowl/validator');
```

All validation requests should follow the following use of the validation function:

```js
validate(
  DataObject {Object<string, any>},
  RuleObject {Object<string, string>}
);
```

The data object should contain the data in key value form that you would like to validate. The rule object should follow the following convention:

```js
{
  dataKey: 'rule|rule'
}
```
<br />

# Rules

## Simple

The simple validation rules are a collection of rules used for type checking and very simple validation scenarios.

### alpha
The field under validation must be entirely alphabetic characters.

### alpha_numeric
The field under validation must be entirely alpha-numeric characters.

### array
The field under validation must be a JavaScript array.

### bool
The field under validation must be able to be cast as a boolean. Accepted input are ```true```, ```false```.

### date
The field under validation must be a valid, non-relative date according to the JavaScript.

### email
The field under validation must be formatted as an e-mail address. Please note that this is a RegEx check and does not conform to RFC based validation. This will also not validate the existance of the email address.

### integer
The field under validation must be an integer. This is a strict integer type test.

### numeric
The field under validation must be numeric. This checks against JavaScripts' numeric type and therefore will accept any of the following ```10```, ```1.99```, ```"111"``` or ```"1.22"```

### object
The field under validation must be a JavaScript object.

### string
The field under validation must be a string.

### za_id_number
The field under validation must be a valid South African identity number. The field is validated agains the Luhn algorithm.
